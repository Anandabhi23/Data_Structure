# Data_Structure
#Set
#  Important function of set
# 1.  add(x)
# add item x to set
### 2. update (x,y,z)\n",
    # To add multiple items to the set\n",
    # It should be either in list or in range\n",
    # copy()
# cloning
# pop()  set does not follow order. It will remove randomly
# remove() it removes specify element from the set
# discard - it remove specified item
# clear()  to remove all element
# ##### Mathematical Operations on Set ---\n",
    ###  1. union() ### x.union(y) or x|y\n",
    ### we can use this function to return all elements present in both sets\n",
    3. Difference\n", Symmetric Difference\n",
     #### Membership Operators in Set (in and not in)\n",
     ##### Dictionary Data Structure\n",
     #### Range - We can create range of values - \n",
     ##### None nothing No values are associated\n",
##### Escape Characters\n",
### \\n == New Line\n",
### Operators in Python\n",
### 1. Arithmetic Operators\n",
#### In string there are 2 operator + and *
#### Bool Data TYpe\n",
#### True and False
#### In Python True represents as 1 and False represents as 0\n",
#Logical operators and , or , not
# and  =  if both arguments are True then the results are True\n",
# or = if atleast one argument is True then result is True\n",
# not  = complement
### if the 1st argumen tis 0, then the rsult is zero other wise the result i y\n",
#### x or y\n",
### if x is true then the result is x other wise result is y\n",
##### Modules in Python  - Modules are bascially packages which stores differnt dunctions related\n",
#### to that module\n",
#### import module_name\n",

     
### if the value isw not available, then to handle such type of cases None are introduced.\n",
